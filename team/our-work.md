## You are always part of the team
Before we start talking about *what* and *how* we work, let's make something clear: at any time, in any setup, under any circumstances, we are part of the **same team**. This is the corner stone of our team culture. Each and every member of the team is **equal** to the other and we all contribute to the development of the team. It doesn't matter if we work in different teams, on different projects with different customers. At the end of the day, we are part of the same team.

## The Projects
Our projects vary a lot in complexity and timeline. We don't have a recipe we follow but we tend to prefer long term collaborations with challenging technical problems. We would rather skip standard CRUD/CMS projects if they don't offer something interesting to focus on. We are also not tied to a specific framework or library as we like to explore new things and try out different combinations. Also, we have no preferences towards frontend/backend projects as we usually like to get involved as **full stack** developers. 

There's a good chunk of the team focusing on the React ecosystem at the moment, but we also have a lot of interest in Node and we have active projects with Express and Koa. Also we are exploring React Native as a solution for cross-platform native applications, but we are also investing effort into PWAs and pushing the limits of the web further and further.

## The Tools
Of course we use git for all our projects and we work on a standard git flow approach with PRs and constant code reviews from your peers. For some of the projects we use [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), but for others we use *bitbucket* or *github*, depending on our collaborators also.

We all have a pretty standard environment on OS-X and we work with either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We follow the same [coding guidelines](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/coding-guidelines.md) and we enforce them in our editors with the corresponding [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) plugins.

Our project setups are pretty straight-forward, you can have a look at a few example/starter projects:
* [Node Starter](https://github.com/FortechRomania/node-starter)
* [Express + Mongo Example](https://github.com/FortechRomania/express-mongo-example-project)
* [React Starter](https://github.com/FortechRomania/react-starter-kit)
* [React + Redux Example](https://github.com/FortechRomania/react-redux-complete-example)

## The Activities
Besides working on the daily tasks, we give each member of the team a chance to get involved in additional activities as part of the regular working hours. There are 3 types of activites or initatives that we tackle, some of them are ongoing and some of them are happening one time:
* personal development activities
* internal company activities
* external company activities

### Personal Development Activities
While personal development should also be done during your own time, we try to offer as much time as possible for personal development during the working hours. We schedule together R&D, open-source or just learning activities that one takes ownership of. Let's say that for example that you want to learn [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or you want to play a little with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). We plan this together with the rest of the team and you have a number of hours allocated to learning this during the working hours. The only condition is to prepare a dissemination of what you found out / learned during the time with the entire team, so that knowledge is distributed to all members. Similarly, you can opt-in to contribute to one of the open-source projects we started on [github](https://github.com/FortechRomania) or to start another one and we plan together some sessions with the team for analysis and review.

### Internal Company Activities
This can vary from participating in tech interviews, to mentoring people as part of our [internship program](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/internship-process.md). If you are more interested in teaching we are heavily involved in internal and external training activities, so we will definitely find time for this. We are also involved in developing some internal tooling for our support departments, so be ready for some potential work in that area.

### External Company Activities
These are the kind of activities that are helping us indirectly by creating a stronger brand around the team/company. But also they can help you build a stronger brand for yourself. So this can vary from being involved into the tech-sales process at Fortech, to speaking at events and conferences and to creating blog posts or external content for our company.

Overall, these activities are molding you into a better professional and are allowing you to try different types of responsibilities to see which one fits you better.
